# Fastlane & CircleCI

Automation is essential for managing builds and deployments across many brands. VennWL-iOS uses Fastlane and CircleCI to automate these processes.

## Fastlane
- Handles building, signing, versioning, and deployment for each brand.
- Uses parameterized lanes (e.g., `deploy name:brandA`) to target specific brands.

### Example Fastlane Command
```
bundle exec fastlane deploy name:brandA
```

## CircleCI
- Defines jobs and workflows for each brand in `.circleci/config.yml`.
- Uses approval steps and per-brand jobs for QA and release control.

### Example CircleCI Workflow (YAML)
```yaml
jobs:
  - build-and-test
  - apple-brandA:
      type: approval
      requires:
        - build-and-test
  - create-signed-ipa:
      fastlane-name: brandA
      tuist-name: BrandA
      requires:
        - apple-brandA
```

## Adding a New Brand to CI
1. Add a new job and workflow step in CircleCI config.
2. Add a Fastlane lane or parameter for the brand.
3. Test the build and deployment pipeline.

## Best Practices
- Keep CI config DRYâ€”use parameters and templates where possible.
- Notify the team of build status via Slack or email.
- Regularly review and clean up old brand configs.
