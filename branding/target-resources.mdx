# Target Resources

Target Resources are where all brand-specific assets, entitlements, and configuration files live. This structure allows each brand to have its own look, feel, and permissions while sharing the same core codebase.

## Directory Structure
```
Target Resources/
  ├── BrandA/
  │    ├── BrandA.entitlements
  │    └── ...
  ├── BrandB/
  │    ├── BrandB.entitlements
  │    └── ...
  └── ...
```

## What Goes Here?
- **Entitlements:** Per-brand `.entitlements` files
- **Assets:** Brand-specific images, icons, etc.
- **Other Configs:** Any files unique to a brand

## Adding New Resources
1. Create a new folder for the brand under `Target Resources/`.
2. Add the required files (entitlements, images, etc.).
3. Reference these resources in the brand’s `.xcconfig` and Tuist setup.

## Best Practices
- Keep brand folders isolated—never share files between brands.
- Use clear, consistent naming (e.g., `BrandName.entitlements`).
- Document any special requirements for a brand.
