# Tech Stack

VennWL-iOS leverages a modern, robust toolchain to support rapid development, automation, and scalability.

## Languages & Frameworks
- **Swift:** Primary language for all app logic and UI.
- **UIKit & SwiftUI:** UIKit is the main UI framework, with some SwiftUI adoption for new features.
- **MVVM:** Architectural pattern for separation of concerns.

## Project & Build Tools
- **Tuist:** Generates Xcode projects, manages modularization, and simplifies multi-brand builds.
- **Xcode:** Appleâ€™s IDE for iOS development.
- **.xcconfig:** Used for per-brand build configuration.

## Automation & CI/CD
- **Fastlane:** Automates building, signing, versioning, and deployment.
- **CircleCI:** Runs tests, builds, and deployments for all brands.
- **Slack:** Receives build and deployment notifications.

## Other Tools
- **Homebrew:** Installs system dependencies (Tuist, Fastlane, etc.).
- **Bundler:** Manages Ruby dependencies for Fastlane.
- **Periphery:** Static analysis for dead code detection.

## Why This Stack?
- **Scalability:** Easily add new brands and features.
- **Automation:** CI/CD ensures quality and speeds up releases.
- **Maintainability:** MVVM and modularization keep code clean and testable.
