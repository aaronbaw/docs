# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection (DI) is used throughout VennWL-iOS to improve testability, flexibility, and modularity.

## What is Dependency Injection?
DI is a pattern where dependencies (services, managers, etc.) are provided to a class rather than hardcoded inside it.

## Approaches Used
- **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are passed in via initializers.
- **Property Injection:** Dependencies are set as properties after initialization.
- **Service Locator:** A shared registry provides dependencies on demand (used sparingly).

## Example: Constructor Injection
```swift
class AnalyticsService {
    func track(event: String) { /* ... */ }
}

class ProductViewModel {
    let analytics: AnalyticsService
    init(analytics: AnalyticsService) {
        self.analytics = analytics
    }
}

// Usage
let analytics = AnalyticsService()
let viewModel = ProductViewModel(analytics: analytics)
```

## Why Use DI?
- **Testability:** Easily inject mocks for unit tests.
- **Flexibility:** Swap implementations without changing consumers.
- **Modularity:** Decouples components for easier maintenance.
