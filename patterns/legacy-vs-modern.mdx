# Legacy vs Modern Code

As the codebase has evolved, some areas use older patterns while others adopt modern best practices.

## Legacy Patterns
- **Singletons:** Used for global state and services
- **Direct Instantiation:** View controllers/services created inline
- **UIKit-only:** All UI in UIKit, little SwiftUI

## Modern Approaches
- **Dependency Injection:** For services and view models
- **MVVM:** Clear separation of concerns
- **SwiftUI:** Used for new features and screens
- **Modularization:** Code split into reusable modules

## Migration Tips
- Refactor singletons to DI where possible
- Move business logic out of view controllers
- Adopt SwiftUI for new UI
- Modularize features for reuse
