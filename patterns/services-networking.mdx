# Services & Networking

All data fetching and business logic in VennWL-iOS is encapsulated in service classes. This keeps networking code out of view controllers and enables easy testing and reuse.

## Structure
- **API Clients:** Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services:** Encapsulate business logic, data fetching, and caching.
- **ViewModels:** Use services to get data and expose it to the UI.

## Example: Product Service
```swift
class ProductService {
    func fetchProduct(id: String, completion: @escaping (Product?) -> Void) {
        // Networking code here (URLSession, Alamofire, etc.)
        // Call completion(product) when done
    }
}

class ProductViewModel {
    let service: ProductService
    var product: Product?
    init(service: ProductService) { self.service = service }
    func loadProduct(id: String) {
        service.fetchProduct(id: id) { [weak self] product in
            self?.product = product
            // Update UI
        }
    }
}
```

## Caching
Some services cache results in memory or on disk for performance.

> **Tip:** Keep networking code out of view controllers for better testability.
