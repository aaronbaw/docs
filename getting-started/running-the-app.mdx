# Running the App

Once your environment is set up, follow these steps to run the app:

1. **Generate the Xcode project with Tuist:**
   ```
   tuist generate
   ```
2. **Open the generated project in Xcode:**
   ```
   open VennWL-iOS.xcworkspace
   ```
3. **Select a scheme and target device** (e.g., simulator or physical device).
4. **Build and run** using the Xcode play button.

> **Tip:** The default scheme will run the main white-label app. See [Adding a New Brand](adding-a-brand) for brand-specific instructions.
