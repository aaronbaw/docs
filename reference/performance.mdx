# Performance Optimization

Performance is critical for a smooth user experience, especially in a modular, server-driven app.

## Profiling with Xcode Instruments
- Use Time Profiler to find slow functions
- Use Allocations to track memory usage
- Use Network to monitor API call performance

## Optimizing Module Rendering
- Reuse cells in collection views
- Avoid heavy computation in the main thread
- Cache images and data where possible

## Best Practices
- Profile on real devices, not just simulators
- Optimize for the slowest supported device
- Monitor app startup time and UI responsiveness

## Real-World Tips
- Batch network requests when possible
- Use lazy loading for images and data
- Regularly review performance metrics in production
