# Debugging & Troubleshooting

Debugging a modular, white-label app can present unique challenges. Here’s how to efficiently diagnose and resolve issues in VennWL-iOS.

## Common Issues
- Build failures due to missing brand resources or configs
- Incorrect module rendering due to server JSON errors
- Authentication or API failures

## Using Xcode’s Debugger
- Set breakpoints in ViewModels, services, or view controllers
- Use the Variables View to inspect state
- Step through code to trace data flow from server to UI

## Logging
- Use `print()` for quick checks
- Use a logging framework (e.g., OSLog) for structured logs
- Log server responses and errors for later analysis

## Troubleshooting Scenarios
### 1. Module Not Rendering
- Check the server JSON for typos or missing attributes
- Ensure the module is registered in `supportedModules`
- Look for decoding errors in the console

### 2. Brand Build Fails
- Verify all required resources exist in `Target Resources/<BrandName>/`
- Check `.xcconfig` for correct paths and settings

### 3. API Call Fails
- Inspect network requests in Xcode’s Network Debugger
- Check for expired tokens or incorrect endpoints

## Tips
- Always test on a clean build and device
- Use Xcode’s “Clean Build Folder” if you see strange issues
- Keep logs and error messages for team troubleshooting
