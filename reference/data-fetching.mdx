# Data Fetching

All data in VennWL-iOS is fetched via service classes that communicate with the backend API.

## How Data is Loaded
- Services use URLSession (or Alamofire) to make HTTP requests.
- Responses are decoded into Swift models using Codable.
- ViewModels request data from services and update the UI.

## Example: Fetching Products
```swift
class ProductService {
    func fetchProducts(completion: @escaping ([Product]) -> Void) {
        // Networking code here
    }
}
```

## Caching
- Frequently used data may be cached in memory or on disk.
- Use NSCache or custom caching logic for performance.

## Adding a New Endpoint
1. Add a method to the relevant service class.
2. Define the model(s) for the response.
3. Update ViewModels/UI as needed.

## Example JSON Response
```json
[
  { "id": "1", "name": "Product A" },
  { "id": "2", "name": "Product B" }
]
```
