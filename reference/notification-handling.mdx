# Notification Handling

VennWL-iOS supports rich push notifications, including images and custom actions.

## How Notifications Work
- The app registers for push notifications with APNs.
- Notifications are received and handled by the app delegate.
- For rich content, the NotificationServiceExtension processes and customizes the notification before display.

## Example: Customizing Notification Content
```swift
// In NotificationService.swift
override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
    // Download image, modify content, etc.
    contentHandler(modifiedContent)
}
```

## Custom Actions
- Add actions (e.g., "View", "Dismiss") to notifications for better engagement.

## Best Practices
- Always test notifications on real devices.
- Handle edge cases (e.g., missing images, expired content).
- Respect user privacy and notification settings.
