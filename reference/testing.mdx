# Testing

Testing ensures the reliability and quality of VennWL-iOS across all brands and features.

## Types of Tests
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions, models, and view models
- **UI Tests:** Simulate user interactions and verify UI behavior
- **Integration Tests:** Test end-to-end flows (e.g., login, checkout)

## Running Tests
- In Xcode: Select the test target and press âŒ˜U
- In CI: Fastlane and CircleCI run tests automatically on each push

## Example: Unit Test
```swift
test func testProductViewModelDisplayName() {
    let product = Product(id: "1", name: "Test")
    let viewModel = ProductViewModel(product: product)
    XCTAssertEqual(viewModel.displayName, "TEST")
}
```

## Best Practices
- Keep tests isolated and fast
- Mock network and service dependencies
- Write tests for new modules and features
- Review test coverage regularly
