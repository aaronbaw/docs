# Analytics & Tracking

Analytics are critical for understanding user behavior and improving the app. VennWL-iOS supports multiple analytics providers and custom event tracking.

## What is Tracked?
- Screen views
- Button taps
- Purchases and conversions
- Custom events (brand-specific)

## Example: Tracking an Event
```swift
AnalyticsHelper.shared.trackEvent(.loadedScreen(screen: .home, className: "ModularHomeViewController"))
```

## Adding a New Event
1. Define the event in the analytics helper or service.
2. Call the tracking method at the appropriate place in the code.

## Per-brand Analytics
- Each brand can have its own analytics configuration (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel).
- Configure providers in the brandâ€™s config or at runtime.

## Best Practices
- Track only what is necessary for product improvement.
- Respect user privacy and opt-out preferences.
- Document all tracked events for future reference.
