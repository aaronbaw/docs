# Authentication

Authentication in VennWL-iOS is designed to be secure, flexible, and extensible for different brands and providers.

## How Login Works
- Users log in via email/password, social login, or SSO (depending on brand).
- Credentials are sent to the backend, which returns an auth token (e.g., JWT).
- The token is stored securely on the device.

## Secure Storage
- Tokens and sensitive data are stored in the iOS Keychain.
- Never store tokens in plain UserDefaults.

## Example: Storing a Token
```swift
import KeychainAccess
let keychain = Keychain(service: "com.vennapps.app")
keychain["authToken"] = token
```

## Adding a New Auth Provider
1. Implement the providerâ€™s login flow (OAuth, SSO, etc.).
2. Store the resulting token in Keychain.
3. Update the authentication service to handle the new provider.

## Best Practices
- Always use secure storage for tokens.
- Handle token refresh and logout securely.
- Provide clear error messages for failed logins.
