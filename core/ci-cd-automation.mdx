# CI/CD & Automation

Automation is key to managing a large white-label codebase. VennWL-iOS uses Fastlane and CircleCI to automate building, testing, and deploying each brand.

## Tools Used
- **Fastlane:** Handles building, signing, versioning, and deployment.
- **CircleCI:** Orchestrates CI/CD pipelines, including per-brand jobs and approval steps.
- **Slack:** Notifies the team of build status and deployment results.

## Workflow
1. Code is pushed to the repository.
2. CircleCI runs tests and builds for all brands.
3. Manual approval steps for QA or release.
4. Fastlane deploys signed IPAs to App Store Connect.
5. Slack notifications for success/failure.
