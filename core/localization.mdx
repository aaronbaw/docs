# Localization

VennWL-iOS supports extensive localization, enabling each brand to reach a global audience.

## How It Works
- Localized strings are stored in `.lproj` folders under `Resources/` (e.g., `en.lproj`, `fr.lproj`).
- Each folder contains a `Localizable.strings` file for that language.
- The app automatically selects the correct language based on device settings.

## Adding a New Language
1. Add a new `.lproj` folder in `Resources/` (e.g., `it.lproj` for Italian).
2. Add or translate the `Localizable.strings` file.
3. (Optional) Add localized assets if needed.

> **Tip:** Test localization by changing the device language in iOS settings.
