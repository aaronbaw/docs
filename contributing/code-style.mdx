# Code Style

Consistent code style makes the codebase easier to read, maintain, and extendâ€”especially in a large, modular project like VennWL-iOS.

## Swift Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Prefer explicit types for properties and function returns
- Use `guard` for early exits
- Keep lines under 120 characters

## Naming Conventions
- Classes/Structs: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ProductViewModel`)
- Variables/Properties: `camelCase` (e.g., `productList`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- Files: Match the main type (e.g., `ProductService.swift`)

## File Organization
- Group related files in folders (e.g., `Services/`, `ViewModels/`)
- One type per file unless tightly coupled
- Use `// MARK:` to organize code sections

## Best Practices
- Write documentation comments for public types and methods
- Avoid force-unwrapping optionals
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Keep modules focused and reusable

## Example
```swift
// MARK: - Product Service
class ProductService {
    func fetchProducts() -> [Product] { /* ... */ }
}
```
