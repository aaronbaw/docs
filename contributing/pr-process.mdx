# Pull Request Process

A clear PR process ensures code quality and smooth collaboration across teams.

## Branching
- Use feature branches: `feature/short-description`
- Use bugfix branches: `fix/short-description`
- Keep branches up to date with `develop`

## PR Requirements
- Write a clear description of changes
- Reference related issues or tickets
- Ensure all tests pass locally
- Run static analysis before submitting

## Code Review
- At least one team member must review and approve
- Address all comments and suggestions
- Discuss major design changes before merging

## CI Checks
- All tests and static analysis must pass in CI
- No merge conflicts with `develop` or `main`

## Merging
- Use "Squash and merge" for a clean history
- Delete the feature branch after merging

## Best Practices
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Document any breaking changes
- Communicate with reviewers for faster turnaround
